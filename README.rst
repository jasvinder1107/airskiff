This project has been integrated into the `Airship Treasuremap <https://github.com/openstack/airship-treasuremap>`_ project.  Please visit the `Airskiff Documentation <https://airship-treasuremap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/airskiff.html>`_!

Skiff (n): a shallow, flat-bottomed open boat

Airskiff (n): A learning and dev environment for Airship

Warning: Work in progress!!

Purpose
-------

Airskiff is an easy way to get started with the software delivery components
of Airship:

* Pegleg
* Shipyard
* Deckhand
* Armada

The scripts in this project are modeled after the All-in-One KubeADM and gate
scripts from the OpenStack-Helm project, so if you're familiar with those you're
halfway there.  The shell scripts can be used to:

* Download, build, and containerize the Airship projects above from source
* Stand up a Kubernetes cluster via KubeADM
* Deploy Shipyard, Deckhand, and Armada via the Helm CLI
* Deploy OpenStack using Airship, declarative YAMLs, and OpenStack-Helm charts

Common Configuration Requirements
---------------------------------

Common configuration requirements covers deployment scenarios that may not be
relevant for every user of Airskiff.

DNS Nameservers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the OpenStack-Helm installation process, the contents of
``/etc/resolv.conf`` are overwritten with the entries in
``openstack-helm-infra/tools/images/kubeadm-aio/assets/opt/playbooks/vars.yaml``
under the ``external_dns_nameserver`` section. After the ``OpenStack-Helm`` and
``OpenStack-Helm-Infra`` repositories are cloned to your parent directory by
the ``tools/deployment/developer/common/005-make-airship.sh`` script during the
setup process, replace the default Google DNS nameservers if you require other
nameservers to reach the internet.

Proxy Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional configuration is necessary to deploy Airskiff behind corporate proxy
servers. This section assumes you have properly defined the standard
``http_proxy``, ``https_proxy``, and ``no_proxy`` environment variables and
have followed the `Docker proxy guide`_ to create a systemd drop-in unit.

Define the following environment variables to enable Airship components to
build behind your proxy servers:

.. code-block:: bash

    export USE_PROXY=true
    export PROXY=${http_proxy}

Run the ``setup-proxy.sh`` script to add your proxy server to the Pegleg
software versions document, enabling Armada to clone charts behind your proxy
server.

.. code-block:: bash

    ./tools/deployment/common/setup-proxy.sh

After the ``OpenStack-Helm`` and ``OpenStack-Helm-Infra`` repositories are
cloned to your parent directory by the
``tools/deployment/developer/common/005-make-airship.sh`` script during the
setup process, follow the `OpenStack-Helm proxy guide`_ to enable deployment of
OpenStack-Helm behind your proxy servers.

Setup
-----

There is a set of scripts for ceph- and nfs-backed cluster storage.  To deploy
the ceph scripts for example, please run these commands in sequence:

::

  cd airskiff
  ./tools/deployment/developer/ceph/000-install-packages.sh
  # You may need to log out and back in at this point to
  # add your userid to the docker group
  ./tools/deployment/developer/ceph/005-make-airship.sh
  ./tools/deployment/developer/ceph/010-deploy-k8s.sh
  ./tools/deployment/developer/ceph/020-setup-client.sh
  ./tools/deployment/developer/ceph/030-ingress.sh
  ./tools/deployment/developer/ceph/040-ceph.sh
  ./tools/deployment/developer/ceph/045-ceph-ns-activate.sh
  ./tools/deployment/developer/ceph/050-mariadb.sh
  ./tools/deployment/developer/ceph/060-rabbitmq.sh
  ./tools/deployment/developer/ceph/070-memcached.sh
  ./tools/deployment/developer/ceph/080-keystone.sh
  ./tools/deployment/developer/ceph/090-postgresql.sh
  ./tools/deployment/developer/ceph/100-barbican.sh
  ./tools/deployment/developer/ceph/110-deckhand.sh
  ./tools/deployment/developer/ceph/120-armada.sh
  ./tools/deployment/developer/ceph/130-shipyard.sh
  ./tools/deployment/developer/ceph/140-pegleg.sh
  ./tools/deployment/developer/ceph/150-deploy-software.sh

Don't forget to read the contents of these scripts as you run them --
learning what's going on is the point!

Once you have a running cluster on your laptop, if you're
doing development on one of these projects (e.g. Shipyard), you can
deploy your changes into a running cluster like so:

::

  cd airship-shipyard
  make
  cd ../airskiff
  ./tools/deployment/developer/common/130-shipyard.sh


Next Steps
----------

After familiarizing yourself with these Airship software delivery projects, you
can move on to the infrastructure provisioning projects Promenade and Drydock.
To demonstrate the full stack of Airship components, please try out the
`Airship-in-a-Bottle <https://github.com/openstack/airship-in-a-bottle>`_
project.

Please bring any questions you have around Airship to the #airshipit IRC
channel on `Freenode <https://webchat.freenode.net>`_.  We would love to welcome
new developers, testers, documenters, and operators!
